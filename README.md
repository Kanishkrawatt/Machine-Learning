# Machine-Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without
being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.<br>
popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection
