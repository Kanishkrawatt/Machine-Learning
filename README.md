# What is AI 
Artificial Intelligence is a branch of Computer Science that is concerned with building smart & intelligent Machines

# What is ML
Machine learning is a technique to implement AL that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

## Types Of ML
* Supervised Learning
   In Supervised Learning , The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Labelled Data
   ```
   ex: We give Data of 2 fruits apple and mango with their names (label) .
      then the machine will decide that the next data fell in which category.
   ```   
   ### Types Of Supervised Learning
   * Classification
      It is about predicting a class or discrete values
      ```
      ex: Male / Female , True / False
      ```
   * Regression
      It is about predicting a quantity or continuos values 
      ```
      ex: salary , age , Price
      ```
   
* Unsupervised Learning
   In Unsupervised Learning , The Machine Learning algorithm learns from Unlabelled Data
   
   ```
   ex: We give Data of fruits without their names (labels). 
      so , it will group them accordingly 
   ```
   
* Reinforcement Learning
   Reinforcement Learning is an area of Machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximize its rewards.
   

# What is DL
Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks to learn from the data




# Machine-Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without
being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.<br>
popular uses include fraud detection, spam filtering, malware threat detection
